  Emerging Poopie was founded in 2016 by a team with a dream to satirically
  highlight Fargo's mediocre, close-knit, and narrow-minded downtown community.
  Our mission is to call attention to the urban-wannabes who poorly mimic what
  makes other cities great while giving themselves kudos for the work others
  have done. We do so by reporting on a wide variety of events and initiatives
  where "misfits" and pseudo-entrepreneurs give advice on topics they read about
  in magazines, heard in DREAD Talks, or learned through insightful FuzzBeed
  quizzes.
